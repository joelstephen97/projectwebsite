                <p>I enjoy developing web applications and working and developing sites. I love everything about programming and I try and keep myself up-to-date.</p>

                <span class="title" id="about-me">About Me</span>

                <p>Coding has always been something that has been interesting to me. <br>
                    From finding QBasic and C++ and making the PC make weird system noises to <br>
                    tearing apart and trying to duplicate/modify HTML in all the late 2000's websites, <br>
                    I knew pretty well that coding was something that I wanted to do. <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast forward to now and I have my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and a few years <br>
                    of solid full-stack experience and nothing has diminished my interest towards programming <br>
                    <br>
                    Any challenge and I'm instantly in the headspace of trying to find a way to resolve an issue. <br>
                    Now I have coding experience in PHP, plenty of scripting, coding and testing experience in Python <br>
                    and experience with Front-end, from prototyping in FIGMA to CSS and HTML. <br>
                    <br>
                    The journey however is a long way from over and I look constantly for new and exciting ideas, <br>
                    technologies and companies to be part of and improve my skills and make a impact while am at it. <br>
